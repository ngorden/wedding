                        Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we have Tinder to thank for bringing us together for
                        a wedding November 1, 2025 (complaints can be directed to the app’s owner—not Emelia). <br /> On
                        Valentine's Day 2019, Emelia swiped right on a guy in a brown leather jacket with striking blue
                        eyes, with what she thought was brown hair poking out from beneath a beanie. Little did she
                        know, Nicholas, the blue-eyed blonde, had already swiped right on a few senior photos of her,
                        taken in the beautiful wilds of Montana.

                    <p>
                        Despite the mix-ups, both were pleasantly surprised after getting to know each other, and by
                        March 18th, they were officially a couple.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fast-forward to February 2020: Emelia moved in with Nicholas to their first apartment. Two weeks
                        later, the COVID-19 lockdown began, and they decided to adopt a cat - Luna - officially
                        expanding their little family. By November, the trio had outgrown their one-bedroom apartment
                        and moved into a two-bedroom in the same complex, where they’ve been making their home ever
                        since.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On March 17th, 2023, they were driving to Los Angeles to celebrate their four-year anniversary.
                        In classic Emelia fashion, a migraine seemed to throw a wrench in their plans. Nicholas, always
                        understanding, suggested they stop at the Oceanside Pier for some fresh air. After a short walk
                        to the end of the pier, they sat on an empty bench…
                    </p>

                    <p>It was there Nicholas said the words that changed everything:</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote pb-2">
                        <p>
                            <span class="lead font-italic">“I love you so much, and I want to love you forever. Will you
                                be my wife?”</span>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>And now, here we are, ready to start the next chapter of our story - forever.</p>
